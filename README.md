## 📖 Overview

**MAEPLE** is not just another mood tracker. It is a **Professional-Grade Health Intelligence Engine** designed to bridge the gap between subjective experience and objective biological signals.

Built with a **neuro-affirming philosophy**, MAEPLE helps users—especially those with ADHD, Autism, or CPTSD—move beyond "symptom surveillance" and towards "pattern literacy." We don't ask "What's wrong with you?"; we ask "What is your context?"

### Why MAEPLE?

-   **🔍 Objective Reality Checks**: Our **Bio-Mirror** technology uses AI vision to detect signs of stress (jaw tension, eye fatigue) that you might be masking, even from yourself.
-   **🔋 Capacity > Mood**: We track a 7-point **Capacity Grid** (Focus, Social, Sensory, etc.) using metrics like **Bandwidth**, **Load**, and **Interference**.
-   **🔒 Privacy First**: Your biometric data is yours. Analysis is performed with strict privacy controls.
