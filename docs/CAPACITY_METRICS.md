# MAEPLE Capacity Metrics: A Neuro-Affirming Framework

**MAEPLE Capacity Metrics** support **pattern literacy**—understanding how context, demands, and recovery affect different parts of daily functioning. Instead of reducing experience to a single score, the system helps describe _what is happening_ and _why_.

This framework replaces one-dimensional metaphors (like "Spoon Theory") with a 7-dimensional system that tracks how a person functions, adapts, and recovers.

## 1. The 7 Domains of Capacity

We track capacity across seven distinct domains, recognizing that neurodivergent individuals often have uneven profiles (spiky profiles).

1.  **Focus**: Cognitive bandwidth for attention and deep work.
2.  **Social**: Capacity for interaction, communication, and presence.
3.  **Sensory**: Tolerance for noise, light, texture, and environmental stimuli.
4.  **Emotional**: Resilience, regulation, and ability to process feelings.
5.  **Physical**: Body energy, pain levels, and stamina.
6.  **Structure**: Need for routine, predictability, and external order.
7.  **Executive**: Ability to plan, initiate, switch tasks, and regulate impulses.

## 2. The Core Metrics

For each domain, we track specific metrics that describe the _state_ of that system.

### 🔋 Bandwidth (Available Capacity)

- **Definition**: The current _available room_ in a domain to take on more demand without crashing.
- **User Language**: "How much fuel is in the tank for this specific area?"
- **Signal**: Subjective ratings, HRV, Sleep quality.

### ⚖️ Load (Current Demand)

- **Definition**: The _active weight_ being placed on a domain right now.
- **User Language**: "How hard is this system working?"
- **Examples**: High Sensory Load (loud office), High Executive Load (complex planning).

### 📡 Interference (System Cross-Talk)

- **Definition**: When stress in one domain disrupts another.
- **User Language**: "Noise on the line."
- **Example**: High Sensory Load causing Emotional Dysregulation.

### 🔊 Noise Generators (Hidden Costs)

- **Definition**: Background processes that drain capacity silently, often related to masking.
- **User Language**: "The hidden cost of passing."
- **Examples**: Suppressing stims (Masking Noise), constant self-monitoring (Social Noise).

### 📶 Signal Quality (Interoception)

- **Definition**: The clarity and trustworthiness of internal cues.
- **User Language**: "Can I trust what I'm feeling?"
- **Relevance**: Critical for users with alexithymia or dissociation.

### 🌊 Stability (Variance)

- **Definition**: How predictable a domain's capacity is over time.
- **User Language**: "Is this steady or volatile?"

### 🔄 Recovery (Replenishment)

- **Definition**: How efficiently a domain restores itself and what specifically helps it.
- **User Language**: "How do I bounce back?"

## 3. The Goal: Pattern Literacy

The ultimate goal of MAEPLE is not to "fix" these numbers but to help users recognize their unique patterns.

> **Example Insight**:
> "Your **Executive Bandwidth** is low today, but **Masking Noise** is high. This creates **Interference** that puts you on a steep **Burnout Trajectory**. Recommendation: Reduce **Sensory Load** to preserve remaining bandwidth."
