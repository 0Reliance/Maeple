# ✨ MAEPLE Features

MAEPLE (Mental And Emotional Pattern Literacy Engine) is designed differently. Unlike traditional health trackers that focus on "symptoms" and "fixing," MAEPLE focuses on **context** and **understanding**.

## 🧠 Neuro-Affirming Core

### Multi-Dimensional Capacity Grid
Forget the linear "1-10" energy scale. We use a **7-point Capacity Grid** to track your energy budget across different domains:
-   **Focus**: Cognitive bandwidth.
-   **Social**: Capacity for interaction.
-   **Sensory**: Tolerance for noise, light, and texture.
-   **Emotional**: Resilience and regulation.
-   **Physical**: Body energy and pain levels.
-   **Structure**: Need for routine vs. flexibility.
-   **Executive**: Ability to plan and initiate tasks.

### Capacity Metrics (The Lexicon)
We use precise language to describe your state:
-   **Bandwidth**: Your available capacity in a domain.
-   **Load**: The current demand placed on you.
-   **Interference**: When one stressed system disrupts another (e.g., Sensory Overload → Emotional Crash).
-   **Noise Generators**: Hidden costs like Masking or Perfectionism.

### The "Spoon" Theory Integration
Native support for "Spoon Theory" tracking, allowing you to visualize your daily energy expenditure and recovery.

## 📸 Bio-Mirror (AI Vision)

An objective reality check for your nervous system. Sometimes we mask so hard we don't realize we're stressed.

-   **Jaw Tension Detection**: AI analyzes micro-expressions to detect clenching.
-   **Eye Fatigue Analysis**: Detects "glassy" eyes or drooping lids indicative of cognitive overload.
-   **Masking Score**: Calculates the disparity between your "social face" and your micro-expressions.
-   **Privacy First**: All image analysis happens **locally** or via secure, stateless AI calls. Your photos are never stored on our servers.

## 📊 Health Metrics Dashboard

A comprehensive view of your longitudinal health data.

-   **Pattern Literacy**: Visualizes the hidden connections between your capacity and your environment.
-   **Burnout Prediction**: Algorithms that analyze trends in sleep, HRV (if connected), and subjective logs to predict burnout risks before they happen.
-   **Cycle Tracking**: Menstrual cycle tracking with a focus on hormonal impacts on neurodivergent traits (e.g., PMDD sensitivity).
-   **Sleep Analytics**: Correlates sleep quality with executive function the next day.
-   **Cold Start Friendly**: Intelligent "Empty States" guide you through your first few days of logging, explaining exactly what data is needed to unlock insights.

## 📝 Smart Journal

-   **Context-Aware Logging**: Tag entries with environmental factors (e.g., "Loud Office", "Bright Lights").
-   **Voice-to-Text**: Frictionless entry for when typing is too much.
-   **Pattern Recognition**: "You tend to report high sensory overload on Tuesdays."

## 🎙️ Mae Live Companion

A real-time, voice-first AI companion designed for neurodivergent processing.

-   **Verbal Processing**: Talk through your day, feelings, or blocks without needing to type.
-   **Neuro-Affirming Persona**: "Mae" is trained to validate, not fix. She understands masking, burnout, and sensory needs.
-   **Live Transcript**: See what you say and what Mae says in real-time bubbles.
-   **Save to Journal**: One-tap save of your entire session transcript to your journal for future reflection or analysis.
-   **Multimodal**: Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp for low-latency voice and text interaction.

## 📄 Capacity Reports

Generate professional, PDF-ready reports for your support team or healthcare providers.

-   **Executive Summary**: High-level trends and concerns.
-   **Visual Charts**: Easy-to-read graphs of mood vs. capacity.
-   **Neuro-Affirming Language**: Reports are written to advocate for your needs, not just list your deficits.

## 🌙 Dark Mode & Accessibility

-   **System-Wide Dark Mode**: Fully optimized for low-light environments to reduce sensory load.
-   **High Contrast Options**: For better readability.
-   **Screen Reader Friendly**: Built with semantic HTML and ARIA labels.
