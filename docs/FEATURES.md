# ✨ MAEPLE Features

MAEPLE (Mental And Emotional Pattern Literacy Engine) is designed differently. Unlike traditional health trackers that focus on "symptoms" and "fixing," MAEPLE focuses on **context** and **understanding**.

## 🧠 Neuro-Affirming Core

### Multi-Dimensional Capacity Grid
Forget the linear "1-10" energy scale. We use a **7-point Capacity Grid** to track your energy budget across different domains:
-   **Focus**: Cognitive bandwidth.
-   **Social**: Capacity for interaction.
-   **Sensory**: Tolerance for noise, light, and texture.
-   **Emotional**: Resilience and regulation.
-   **Physical**: Body energy and pain levels.
-   **Structure**: Need for routine vs. flexibility.
-   **Executive**: Ability to plan and initiate tasks.

### Capacity Metrics (The Lexicon)
We use precise language to describe your state:
-   **Bandwidth**: Your available capacity in a domain.
-   **Load**: The current demand placed on you.
-   **Interference**: When one stressed system disrupts another (e.g., Sensory Overload → Emotional Crash).
-   **Noise Generators**: Hidden costs like Masking or Perfectionism.

### The "Spoon" Theory Integration
Native support for "Spoon Theory" tracking, allowing you to visualize your daily energy expenditure and recovery.

## 📸 Bio-Mirror (AI Vision)

An objective reality check for your nervous system. Sometimes we mask so hard we don't realize we're stressed.

-   **Scientific Foundation**: Uses the **Facial Action Coding System (FACS)** to identify specific Action Units (AUs) associated with stress and fatigue.
-   **Physiological Markers**:
    -   **Fatigue**: Detects Ptosis (lid droop) and Glazed Gaze (AU63).
    -   **Tension**: Identifies Lip Pressor (AU24) and Masseter (Jaw) tension.
    -   **Masking**: Compares Zygomatic Major (Smile) vs. Orbicularis Oculi (Eye crinkle) to distinguish "social" smiles from authentic ones.
-   **Privacy First**: All image analysis happens **locally** or via secure, stateless AI calls. Your photos are never stored on our servers.

## 📊 Health Metrics Dashboard

A comprehensive view of your longitudinal health data.

-   **Pattern Literacy**: Visualizes the hidden connections between your capacity and your environment.
-   **Burnout Prediction**: Algorithms that analyze trends in sleep, HRV (if connected), and subjective logs to predict burnout risks before they happen.
-   **Cycle Tracking**: Menstrual cycle tracking with a focus on hormonal impacts on neurodivergent traits (e.g., PMDD sensitivity).
-   **Sleep Analytics**: Correlates sleep quality with executive function the next day.
-   **Cold Start Friendly**: Intelligent "Empty States" guide you through your first few days of logging, explaining exactly what data is needed to unlock insights.

## 📝 Enhanced Multi-Mode Journal

-   **Multi-Mode Input**: Choose the entry method that works for you right now:
      - **Text Entry**: Traditional journaling with real-time AI analysis
      - **Voice Recording**: Live transcription with audio analysis (Web Speech API)
      - **Photo Capture (Bio-Mirror)**: Visual analysis for objective physiological markers
   - **Objective Data Collection**: AI analyzes your input for:
      - **Voice Observations**: Pitch, pace, energy, noise levels, breathing patterns
      - **Photo Observations**: Fatigue markers (Ptosis, glazed gaze), tension indicators, environmental context
      - **Text Observations**: Environmental mentions (noise, lighting, etc.)
   - **Informed Capacity Calibration**: AI suggests capacity values based on objective observations
      - Shows **"Informed by" badges** explaining why suggestions were made
      - All suggestions can be overridden by user
      - Real-time updates as observations change
   - **Gentle Inquiry System**: Context-aware, optional AI questions
      - Questions based on objective observations (e.g., "I noticed high noise levels. How is this affecting your focus?")
      - Quick response buttons for easy interaction
      - Custom input always available
      - Skip always prominent - never forced
      - Neuro-affirming, curious tone (not interrogative)
   - **Context-Aware Strategies**: Enhanced recommendations based on both subjective reports and objective data
   - **Pattern Recognition**: "You tend to report high sensory overload on Tuesdays."

### Why This Matters

Multi-mode journaling transforms MAEPLE from "symptom surveillance" to **pattern literacy**:
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Text + voice + photo = richer, more accurate patterns
- **Objective Support**: When you're masking or dissociating, objective data validates or gently challenges your self-perception
- **Flexible Access**: Choose the input method that matches your current capacity
- **Evidence-Based**: Build a data foundation for self-advocacy with healthcare providers

## 🎙️ Mae Live Companion

A real-time, voice-first AI companion designed for neurodivergent processing.

-   **Verbal Processing**: Talk through your day, feelings, or blocks without needing to type.
-   **Neuro-Affirming Persona**: "Mae" is trained to validate, not fix. She understands masking, burnout, and sensory needs.
-   **Live Transcript**: See what you say and what Mae says in real-time bubbles.
-   **Save to Journal**: One-tap save of your entire session transcript to your journal for future reflection or analysis.
-   **Multimodal**: Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp for low-latency voice and text interaction.

## 📄 Capacity Reports

Generate professional, PDF-ready reports for your support team or healthcare providers.

-   **Executive Summary**: High-level trends and concerns.
-   **Visual Charts**: Easy-to-read graphs of mood vs. capacity.
-   **Neuro-Affirming Language**: Reports are written to advocate for your needs, not just list your deficits.
