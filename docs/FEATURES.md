# ✨ MAEPLE Features

MAEPLE (Mental And Emotional Pattern Literacy Engine) emphasizes **context** and **understanding**. The goal is to help users recognize patterns over time and make the data easier to reflect on and share.

## 🎯 Gentle Onboarding

Your first experience with MAEPLE is thoughtfully designed:

### Onboarding Experience

- **5-Step Tutorial**: Walks you through what MAEPLE does and why it matters
- **User-Focused Messaging**: Each step emphasizes outcomes, not features
  - Step 1: "Understand Yourself Better" - Focus on self-compassion
  - Step 2: "See Your Patterns Clearly" - Focus on practical awareness
  - Step 3: "Meet Mae" - Your personal pattern analyst
  - Step 4: "Your Data Stays Yours" - Privacy-first approach
  - Step 5: "Your Pattern Journey Starts with One Entry" - Getting started
- **Skip Button**: Can exit anytime without guilt. You can replay it later from Settings
- **Replay Anytime**: Go to Settings → Help & Resources → Replay Onboarding Tutorial
- **Smart Detection**: Only shows for true first-time users, survives browser cache clearing

### Why This Matters

- No judgment, no pressure
- You control your learning pace
- Can explore the app without mandatory onboarding
- Can review content whenever you need a refresher

## 🧠 Neuro-Affirming Core

### Multi-Dimensional Capacity Grid

Instead of a single "1-10" energy scale, MAEPLE uses a **7-domain Capacity Grid** to track capacity across different domains:

- **Focus**: Cognitive bandwidth.
- **Social**: Capacity for interaction.
- **Sensory**: Tolerance for noise, light, and texture.
- **Emotional**: Resilience and regulation.
- **Physical**: Body energy and pain levels.
- **Structure**: Need for routine vs. flexibility.
- **Executive**: Ability to plan and initiate tasks.

### Capacity Metrics (The Lexicon)

We use precise language to describe your state:

- **Bandwidth**: Your available capacity in a domain.
- **Load**: The current demand placed on you.
- **Interference**: When one stressed system disrupts another (e.g., Sensory Overload → Emotional Crash).
- **Noise Generators**: Hidden costs like Masking or Perfectionism.

### The "Spoon" Theory Integration

Native support for "Spoon Theory" tracking, allowing you to visualize your daily energy expenditure and recovery.

## 📸 Bio-Mirror (AI Vision)

An optional photo-based check-in that can add structured context alongside self-report.

- **Scientific Foundation**: Uses the **Facial Action Coding System (FACS)** developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen to identify specific Action Units (AUs) associated with stress, fatigue, and emotional authenticity.

- **Enhanced FACS Detection (v0.97.6)**:
  - **Structured AU Codes**: Detects and reports specific Action Units (AU1, AU4, AU6, AU12, AU24, AU43, etc.)
  - **Intensity Ratings**: Each AU rated on scientific A-E scale (Trace to Maximum)
  - **Duchenne Smile Analysis**: Distinguishes genuine smiles (AU6+AU12) from social/posed smiles (AU12 alone)
  - **Masking Indicators**: Identifies when facial expression contradicts reported emotional state

- **Physiological Markers**:
  - **Fatigue**: AU43 (Eyes Closed), ptosis (lid droop), reduced overall expression
  - **Tension**: AU4 (Brow Lowerer), AU24 (Lip Pressor), AU14 (Dimpler)
  - **Authenticity**: AU6+AU12 combination for genuine vs. social smile detection
  - **Masking**: Compares Zygomatic Major (Smile) vs. Orbicularis Oculi (Eye crinkle) to distinguish "social" smiles from authentic ones.
- **Privacy**: Bio-Mirror photos and results are stored locally by default. Cloud sync does not upload Bio-Mirror history. If you enable AI analysis, the captured image is sent to the selected provider for processing.

## 📊 Health Metrics Dashboard

A comprehensive view of your longitudinal health data.

- **Pattern Literacy**: Visualizes the hidden connections between your capacity and your environment.
- **Burnout Prediction**: Algorithms that analyze trends in sleep, HRV (if connected), and subjective logs to predict burnout risks before they happen.
- **Cycle Tracking**: Menstrual cycle tracking with a focus on hormonal impacts on neurodivergent traits (e.g., PMDD sensitivity).
- **Sleep Analytics**: Correlates sleep quality with executive function the next day.
- **Cold Start Friendly**: Intelligent "Empty States" guide you through your first few days of logging, explaining exactly what data is needed to unlock insights.

## 📝 Enhanced Multi-Mode Journal

- **Multi-Mode Input**: Choose the entry method that works for you right now:
  - **Text Entry**: Traditional journaling with real-time AI analysis
  - **Voice Recording**: Live transcription with audio analysis (Web Speech API)
  - **Photo Capture (Bio-Mirror)**: Visual analysis for objective physiological markers
- **Objective Data Collection**: AI analyzes your input for:
  - **Voice Observations**: Pitch, pace, energy, noise levels, breathing patterns
  - **Photo Observations**: Fatigue markers (Ptosis, glazed gaze), tension indicators, environmental context
  - **Text Observations**: Environmental mentions (noise, lighting, etc.)
- **Informed Capacity Calibration**: AI suggests capacity values based on objective observations
  - Shows **"Informed by" badges** explaining why suggestions were made
  - All suggestions can be overridden by user
  - Real-time updates as observations change
- **Gentle Inquiry System**: Context-aware, optional AI questions
  - Questions based on objective observations (e.g., "I noticed high noise levels. How is this affecting your focus?")
  - Quick response buttons for easy interaction
  - Custom input always available
  - Skip always prominent - never forced
  - Neuro-affirming, curious tone (not interrogative)
- **Context-Aware Strategies**: Enhanced recommendations based on both subjective reports and objective data
- **Pattern Recognition**: "You tend to report high sensory overload on Tuesdays."

### Why This Matters

Multi-mode journaling supports **pattern literacy**:

- **Multiple Data Sources**: Text + voice + photo = richer, more accurate patterns
- **Objective Support**: When you're masking or dissociating, objective data validates or gently challenges your self-perception
- **Flexible Access**: Choose the input method that matches your current capacity
- **Evidence-Based**: Build a data foundation for self-advocacy with healthcare providers
