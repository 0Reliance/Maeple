# POZIMIND State Check: The 6-Phase Strategic Plan

## Status: 🚀 PRODUCTION READY (Alpha v1.1)

### **Phase 1: The Privacy-First Data Foundation (COMPLETE)**
**Goal:** Build a secure, local-only storage system that can handle sensitive biometric data.
- [x] Implement `idb` wrapper for IndexedDB.
- [x] Create `StateCheck` schema and types.
- [x] Implement `encryptionService` (AES-GCM) for local data protection.
- [x] Build `stateCheckService` for Blob storage.

### **Phase 2: The Neuro-Vision Intelligence (COMPLETE)**
**Goal:** Engineer the AI prompt to detect *neurodivergent markers* (masking, fatigue).
- [x] Implement `geminiVisionService` with `gemini-2.5-flash`.
- [x] Design "Neuro-Analyst" system instruction for Jaw Tension/Eye Fatigue.
- [x] Define JSON schema for structured analysis.

### **Phase 3: The "Calm Capture" Experience (COMPLETE)**
**Goal:** Create a selfie flow that is grounding, not anxiety-inducing.
- [x] Build `StateCheckCamera` with video stream handling.
- [x] Implement `StateCheckWizard` orchestrator.
- [x] Add "Analyzing" loader state.

### **Phase 4: The Comparison & Discrepancy Engine (COMPLETE)**
**Goal:** The "Aha!" moment. Comparing Subjective Report vs. Objective Reality.
- [x] Build `comparisonEngine` logic.
- [x] Calculate `DiscrepancyScore` (Subjective Mood vs Objective Tension).
- [x] Generate "Reality Check" insights.

### **Phase 5: Interface & Visualization (COMPLETE)**
**Goal:** Present complex biometric data simply and kindly.
- [x] Build `StateCheckResults` UI.
- [x] Visualize Masking Score and Fatigue.
- [x] Implement "Save Securely" functionality.

### **Phase 6: Longitudinal Trends & Calibration (COMPLETE)**
**Goal:** Contextualize the data over time and establish user baseline.
- [x] Add `getRecentStateChecks` to retrieve historical data.
- [x] Create `StateTrendChart` component.
- [x] Integrate Bio-Mirror trends into Main Dashboard.
- [x] Add "Baseline Calibration" mode for neutral face learning.
- [x] Integrate baseline delta logic into Comparison Engine.
