## Step-by-Step Messaging Changes

### STEP 1: WELCOME

**BEFORE:**
```
Title:    "Welcome to MAEPLE"
Subtitle: "Your Mental And Emotional Pattern Literacy Engine"
Icon:     ✨ Sparkles (amber)

Content:
- "MAEPLE helps you understand your unique neurological patterns—
   not to fix you, but to help you work with your brain, 
   not against it."
- [Callout box] "Created by and for neurodivergent minds who need 
                a gentler approach to self-tracking."
```

**AFTER:**
```
Title:    "Understand Yourself Better"
Subtitle: "Without judgment, without pressure"
Icon:     ✨ Sparkles (amber)

Content:
- "MAEPLE helps you see your own patterns clearly. Not to fix you, 
   but to help you work with yourself—exactly as you are."
- [Callout box] "Created by and for neurodivergent minds. 
                No shame. No expectations. Just awareness."

CHANGE RATIONALE:
✓ Title is now outcome-focused ("Understand Better")
✓ Subtitle is user-centric ("for you" not "for tracking")
✓ Messaging emphasizes self-acceptance, not neurodiversity fixes
✓ Removes jargon ("neurological patterns" → removed)
```

---

### STEP 2: PATTERNS

**BEFORE:**
```
Title:    "Pattern Literacy Over Surveillance"
Subtitle: "Learn your patterns, don't police them"
Icon:     🧠 Brain (indigo)

Content:
- "Traditional mood trackers ask 'What did you do wrong?' 
   MAEPLE asks 'What patterns are you noticing?'"
- [2-column grid]
  Left:  "Capacity Tracking" - "Track your 7 capacity dimensions 
                                across social, sensory, focus, etc"
  Right: "Bio-Mirror" - "AI analysis helps you see what you might 
                         not notice about yourself"
```

**AFTER:**
```
Title:    "See Your Patterns Clearly"
Subtitle: "Know yourself so you can plan your life"
Icon:     🧠 Brain (indigo)

Content:
- "Most self-tracking apps ask 'What did you do wrong?' 
   We ask 'What's really going on with you right now?'"
- [2 stacked boxes with borders]
  1. "Capacity Tracking" - "Track 7 dimensions of your wellbeing—
                           social, sensory, focus, and more. 
                           Know when you're running on fumes."
  2. "Pattern Recognition" - "After a few entries, you'll start 
                             seeing what makes you tick. Real, 
                             actionable patterns."

CHANGE RATIONALE:
✓ Title focuses on benefit ("See Clearly") not concept ("Literacy")
✓ Subtitle explains real-world outcome ("plan your life")
✓ "Running on fumes" adds emotional resonance
✓ "Bio-Mirror" → "Pattern Recognition" (more understandable)
✓ More space for breathing room (stacked vs grid)
```

### STEP 3: MAE

**BEFORE:**
```
Title:    "Meet Mae"
Subtitle: "Your empathetic pattern companion"
Icon:     ❤️ Heart (rose)

Content:
- [Avatar with emoji] 🌸 Mae - "Empathetic Pattern Guide"
- "Mae reads your journal entries and helps translate your 
   experiences into actionable strategies—without judgment, 
   without prescriptions, just pattern recognition."
- [Italic quote] "You're not broken—you're just running 
                  different software."
```

**AFTER:**
```
Title:    "Meet Mae"
Subtitle: "Your personal pattern analyst"
Icon:     ❤️ Heart (rose)

Content:
- [Avatar with emoji] 🌸 Mae - "Your empathetic pattern guide"
- "Mae reads what you write and helps you see patterns you might 
   miss. She translates your experiences into strategies that 
   actually fit your brain—not someone else's."
- [Callout box] "💡 Not a diagnosis. Not prescriptive. 
               Just honest pattern recognition."

CHANGE RATIONALE:
✓ Subtitle: "companion" → "analyst" (more actionable role)
✓ "reads your journal entries" → "reads what you write" (more human)
✓ Added "actually fit YOUR brain" (emphasizes personalization)
✓ Changed quote format to callout (more prominent, clearer info)
✓ "You're not broken" message kept but in different format
```

---

### STEP 4: PRIVACY

**BEFORE:**
```
Title:    "Privacy First"
Subtitle: "Your data stays on your device"
Icon:     🛡️ Shield (emerald)

Content:
- "MAEPLE is local-first. Your journal entries, capacity data, 
   and patterns never leave your device."
- [3 list items with icons]
  ✓ Encrypted local storage
  ✓ No accounts required
  ✓ Export your data anytime
```

**AFTER:**
```
Title:    "Your Data Stays Yours"
Subtitle: "Privacy is not optional"
Icon:     🛡️ Shield (emerald)

Content:
- "Your journal, your capacity ratings, your patterns—they all 
   stay on your device. We never see them. We never store them. 
   Period."
- [3 list items with icons in bordered boxes]
  🔒 Encrypted local storage
  ✓ No account required. Ever.
  ✓ Export everything anytime

CHANGE RATIONALE:
✓ Title: More declarative ("Your Data Stays Yours" vs "Privacy First")
✓ Subtitle: "Privacy is not optional" (stronger stance)
✓ Repeated "your" emphasizes ownership
✓ Added strength: "We never see them" (twice for emphasis)
✓ "Period." (conversational strength)
✓ "No account required. Ever." (humor + reassurance)
✓ Added box borders around privacy features (visual emphasis)
```

---

### STEP 5: GETTING STARTED

**BEFORE:**
```
Title:    "Ready to Begin?"
Subtitle: "Start your pattern literacy journey"
Icon:     ✨ Sparkles (indigo)

Content:
- "Here's how to get the most from MAEPLE:"
- [3 numbered steps]
  1. "Journal daily" — Just a few sentences about how you're feeling
  2. "Use the sliders" — Rate your capacity across different dimensions
  3. "Check your patterns" — Visit the Dashboard after 3+ entries
- [Center text] "No pressure. No streaks. Just awareness."
```

**AFTER:**
```
Title:    "Ready to Begin?"
Subtitle: "Your pattern journey starts with one entry"
Icon:     ✨ Sparkles (indigo)

Content:
- "Getting started is simple. Here's what works:"
- [3 numbered steps]
  1. "Write a quick entry" — Just a few sentences about how you're 
     feeling right now
  2. "Rate your capacity" — Use the sliders to show where you're 
     at right now
  3. "Keep going" — After 3-5 entries, patterns will start 
     becoming visible
- [Callout box] "⏰ Real talk: This isn't a weekend sprint. 
                Real patterns emerge over weeks. Be patient 
                with yourself."

CHANGE RATIONALE:
✓ Subtitle: More grounded ("starts with one entry" vs "pattern 
           literacy journey")
✓ "Journal daily" → "Write a quick entry" (less daunting)
✓ "right now" added (reduces anxiety about perfect answers)
✓ "Check your patterns" → "Keep going" (motivation, not instruction)
✓ "3+" → "3-5" (more specific expectation)
✓ Added reality check: "not a weekend sprint" (honest expectations)
✓ "Be patient with yourself" (emotional support)
✓ Callout format more prominent (key message)
```

## Technical Implementation Comparison

### Detection Logic

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
const onboardingComplete = 
  localStorage.getItem('maeple_onboarding_complete') === 'true';
set({ showOnboarding: !onboardingComplete });

// Problem: If user clears localStorage, onboarding re-appears
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
const onboardingCompleted =
  localStorage.getItem('maeple_onboarding_complete') === 'true';
const shouldShowOnboarding = !onboardingCompleted && entries.length === 0;
set({ showOnboarding: shouldShowOnboarding });

// Benefit: User with any entries won't see onboarding again
//          even if localStorage is cleared
```

## User Flow Comparison

### BEFORE: Only 2 Paths
```
┌─── Start App ───┐
│                 │
├─ No localStorage flag → Show Onboarding ──┐
│                                            │
└─ Has localStorage flag → Skip Onboarding  │
                                            │
        ┌────────────────────────────────────┘
        │
        ├─ Click "Start Journaling" → Hide Modal
        │                            → Mark complete
        │
        └─ No way to skip mid-flow
```

### AFTER: Multiple Paths + Recovery
```
┌──── Start App ────┐
│                   │
├─ entries.length === 0 → Show Onboarding ──┐
│                                            │
├─ entries.length > 0 → Skip Onboarding ─┐  │
│                                        │  │
└─ (regardless of localStorage flag)     │  │
                                         │  │
        ┌────────────────────────────────┴──┘
        │
        ├─ Path A: Click "Start Journaling" → Hide Modal
        │                                   → Mark complete
        │
        ├─ Path B: Click "Skip" → Hide Modal
        │                       → User sees app
        │                       → On next visit: Onboarding returns
        │                          (since still 0 entries)
        │
        └─ Path C: In Settings → Click "Replay Onboarding"
                               → Show Onboarding anytime
```
