# How to Use POZIMIND
> *Your Neuro-Affirming Companion for Pattern Literacy*

Welcome to POZIMIND. This tool is designed to help you move from **Symptom Surveillance** ("I feel broken") to **Pattern Literacy** ("I am running at high capacity in a low-resource environment").

This guide will walk you through the core features and how to use them to prevent burnout and thrive.

## 1. The Core Philosophy

POZIMIND tracks **Context**, not just symptoms. To get the most out of it, you need to track three dimensions:
1.  **Capacity (Spoons):** How much energy do you *actually* have available?
2.  **Demand (Load):** What is costing you energy? (Sensory noise, Masking, Task switching).
3.  **Output (Mood):** How do you feel as a result?

## 2. Daily Routine: The "Check-In"

### ☀️ Morning: Set Your Baseline
Before you start your day, go to the **Smart Journal**.
1.  Open the **Capacity Check-in** (click the ⚡ icon).
2.  Adjust the sliders based on how you feel *right now*.
    *   *Low Sleep?* Lower your **Physical** and **Executive** spoons.
    *   *Luteal Phase?* Lower your **Sensory** tolerance.
3.  This tells the AI your "Budget" for the day.

### 📝 During the Day: Contextual Logging
When logging an entry, don't just say "I'm tired." Add context:
*   **Activity:** "Had 3 back-to-back meetings." (AI detects: High Context Switching)
*   **Environment:** "The office lights are buzzing." (AI detects: High Sensory Load)
*   **Social:** "Had to pretend to be happy at lunch." (AI detects: High Masking)

**Pro Tip:** Use the **Microphone** button. Just talk naturally. The AI is trained to pick up on neurodivergent nuances like "Brain Fog" or "Hyperfocus".

### 📸 Mid-Day: The Bio-Mirror (State Check)
If you feel "off" but can't name the emotion (Alexithymia), or if you suspect you are masking heavily:

1.  Go to **Bio-Mirror (State Check)** in the menu.
2.  **Reflect:** Follow the 10-second breathing prompt to center yourself.
3.  **Capture:** Take a quick selfie. Ensure your face is well-lit.
4.  **Analyze:** The AI looks for physical markers:
    *   **Jaw Tension:** A primary sign of stress suppression.
    *   **Eye Fatigue:** Indicators of cognitive exhaustion.
    *   **Masking Score:** Is your expression "performing" happiness while showing stress?
5.  **Reality Check:** The app compares your physical state to your last journal entry.
    *   *Discrepancy Detected?* If you wrote "I'm fine" but your jaw tension is 9/10, you might be dissociating. Take a break immediately.

## 3. Weekly Review: The Dashboard

Visit the **Pattern Dashboard** once a week to spot trends.

*   **Burnout Trajectory:** Look at the gauge. If it says **CRITICAL**, you have exceeded your capacity for >3 days. Schedule a "Rot Day" (Passive Rest).
*   **Hormonal Weather:** Check your cycle phase.
    *   *Follicular?* High energy. Do hard tasks.
    *   *Luteal?* Low energy. Be kind to yourself.
*   **Cognitive Load:** If "Context Switches" are high (>8), try "Time Blocking" next week (grouping similar tasks).
