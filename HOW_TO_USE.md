# How to Use POZIMIND
> *Your Neuro-Affirming, Professional Companion for Pattern Literacy*


Welcome to POZIMIND. This is more than an app—it’s a movement to help you move from **Symptom Surveillance** (“I feel broken”) to **Pattern Literacy** (“I am running at high capacity in a low-resource environment”).

POZIMIND is built for real-world impact, clinical reliability, and privacy-first care. Every feature is designed to empower you with actionable insights, not just data.

This guide will walk you through the core features and how to use them to prevent burnout and thrive.

> **New (Beta v5):** AI is now multi-provider. Gemini is the default; you can add OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, OpenRouter, local Ollama, or Z.ai under **Settings → AI Providers**. Keys are stored encrypted locally, and the router will gracefully fall back to Gemini if others are disabled or fail.

> **Voice tips:** When using Pozi Live or the Journal mic, allow microphone access. In Pozi Live you should see “Listening…” after tapping the mic; if not, confirm your Gemini key is set.

## 1. The Core Philosophy

POZIMIND tracks **Context**, not just symptoms. To get the most out of it, you need to track three dimensions:
1.  **Capacity (Spoons):** How much energy do you *actually* have available?
2.  **Demand (Load):** What is costing you energy? (Sensory noise, Masking, Task switching).
3.  **Output (Mood):** How do you feel as a result?

## 2. Daily Routine: The "Check-In"

### ☀️ Morning: Set Your Baseline
Before you start your day, go to the **Smart Journal**.
1.  Open the **Capacity Check-in** (click the ⚡ icon).
2.  Adjust the sliders based on how you feel *right now*.
    *   *Low Sleep?* Lower your **Physical** and **Executive** spoons.
    *   *Luteal Phase?* Lower your **Sensory** tolerance.
3.  This tells the AI your "Budget" for the day.

### 📝 During the Day: Contextual Logging
When logging an entry, don't just say "I'm tired." Add context:
*   **Activity:** "Had 3 back-to-back meetings." (AI detects: High Context Switching)
*   **Environment:** "The office lights are buzzing." (AI detects: High Sensory Load)
*   **Social:** "Had to pretend to be happy at lunch." (AI detects: High Masking)

**Pro Tip:** Use the **Microphone** button. Just talk naturally. The AI is trained to pick up on neurodivergent nuances like "Brain Fog" or "Hyperfocus".

### 📸 Mid-Day: The Bio-Mirror (State Check)
If you feel "off" but can't name the emotion (Alexithymia), or if you suspect you are masking heavily:

1.  **Calibrate First (Important):** Go to **Settings > Bio-Mirror Calibration**. Take a photo of your "Neutral / Resting Face". This teaches the AI your baseline, so it doesn't mistake your natural expression for fatigue.
2.  **Reflect:** Go to **Bio-Mirror** and follow the 10-second breathing prompt.
3.  **Capture:** Take a quick selfie.
4.  **Analyze:** The AI looks for changes from your baseline:
    *   **Jaw Tension:** A primary sign of stress suppression.
    *   **Eye Fatigue:** Indicators of cognitive exhaustion.
    *   **Masking Score:** Is your expression "performing" happiness while showing stress?
5.  **Reality Check:** The app compares your physical state to your last journal entry.
    *   *Discrepancy Detected?* If you wrote "I'm fine" but your jaw tension is elevated above your baseline, you might be dissociating.

## 3. Weekly Review: The Dashboard

Visit the **Pattern Dashboard** once a week to spot trends.

*   **Burnout Trajectory:** Look at the gauge. If it says **CRITICAL**, you have exceeded your capacity for >3 days. Schedule a "Rot Day" (Passive Rest).
*   **Bio-Signal Trends:** Look at the Orange (Tension) vs Purple (Masking) chart. Does high masking on Tuesday lead to high physical tension on Wednesday?
*   **Hormonal Weather:** Check your cycle phase.
    *   *Follicular?* High energy. Do hard tasks.
    *   *Luteal?* Low energy. Be kind to yourself.
*   **Cognitive Load:** If "Context Switches" are high (>8), try "Time Blocking" next week (grouping similar tasks).
